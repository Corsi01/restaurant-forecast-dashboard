## 📊 Overview

Prophet models for **6 restaurants** and **2 dimensions** (bills and total sales) were fitted using **temporal cross-validation** and **grid search** to test different configurations of seasonalities, holidays, regressors, and solutions to handle COVID-19 influence.

The models were deployed in an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** that allows users to:

- 📈 **Generate predictions** using fitted models
- 🔄 **Update models** with new data
- 📉 **Compare predicted vs real values**
- 🔍 **Analyze components** (trend, holidays effect, seasonalities)
